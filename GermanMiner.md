# GermanMiner
###### GermanMiner is a copyright of staips.net - IT-Service. This is a community modpack, made to improve the user experience without breaking any rules. This project or I am not affiliated with them in any shape or form.

**A fully client-side Fabric Modpack with seamless LabyMod compatibility and lots of Features like:**
- Optimized game performance in single- and multiplayer
- Full OptiFine feature and Ressourcepack support
- More animations, particles, and sounds
- Schematic support with Litematica
and way more, while being fully compatible with the GermanMiner server.

[Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/), [LabyMod Launcher](https://labymod.net/), [Modrinth Launcher](https://modrinth.com/app)  & [CurseForge Launcher](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) are supported.

It is currently being shipped without any predefined configs; this will change soon™️ though.

### Please use [the 1.21.10 Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/germanminer/versions?g=1.21.10) as that's the actual server version of GM, even though they advertise up to 1.21.11!
